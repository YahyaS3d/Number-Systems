# Number-Systems
this program receives from the screen strings of digits representing positive integers in one of three bases - decimal base (10) binary base (2) and octal base (8). After selecting a base from the list, the program picks up the string and converts it to its numeric value. The numbers will be stored in an array of integers variables.
