# Number-Systems
this program receives from the screen strings of digits representing positive integers in one of three bases - decimal base (10) binary base (2) and octal base (8). After selecting a base from the list, the program picks up the string and converts it to its numeric value. The numbers will be stored in an array of integers variables.<br />
An example of running the program after entering a decimal number: <br />
You are in Decimal Mode<br />
1. Change Base.<br />
2. Enter a number.<br />
3. Find a number.<br />
4. Get the amount of even numbers.<br />
5 Print.<br />
6. Exit.<br />

1- to change the base 2- to enter another number to the list 3- searching if an entering number is already in the list 4- return how many even numbers in the list 5- print the list 6- exit from the program!!
